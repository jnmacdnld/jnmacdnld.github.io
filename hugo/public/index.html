  <li>Personal Role: Software Team Member</li>
  <li>Timeframe: September 2015 â€“ July 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>
<p>CUAUV was my first experience working on a relatively complex
robotics project, an underwater robot with a 50-person team
consisting of about 15 software team members. (I had competed in high
school robotics, but I was leading a relatively small 3-person team.)
The objective of CUAUV is
to produce a robot to compete in the international RoboSub
competition. As a team member, I developed an interest
in computer vision, researching topics such as graph-based image
segmentation to enable object detection invariant to lighting
conditions and visual egomotion in order to caculate velocity without
an expensive sonar sensor. I implemented simple proof-of-concept prototype
algorithms for both of these.</p>

<p>As the competition takes in July, some team members opt to stay
on-campus over the summer to work on the robot. I opted to stay
during Summer 2016 as a sophomre. I worked extensively on computer vision algorithms
and high-level state machine and control logic to
to complete the &ldquo;Torpedoes&rdquo; task at RoboSub 2016. The task consisted of
identifing targets labeled with letters, removing a physical cover from a target,
and shooting plastic projectiles at targets with specified letters.
(Video and images are shown below.) I spent nearly all of my time
that summer writing computer vision code, testing and collecting logs in the pool,
and revising and re-desgining code as needed to account for new failure
modes, re-running against the collected log data, and finally
re-testing in the pool.</p>

<p>I had a fantastic experience attending RoboSub 2016, speaking with
other teams about how they had approached the challenges and watching
my code manuver the vehicle around the obstacle course. I was super
excited when our team acheived third place.</p>
