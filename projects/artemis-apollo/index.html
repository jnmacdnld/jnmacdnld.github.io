<h3>More About My Experience</h3>
<p>
  <p>After an exciting first year on the team, I was chosen to be one of the
two software team leads, overseeing 15 software team members developing
all of the software running on the main computer including that for vehicle
control, computer vision, acoustic localization, and high level state
machine logic. I emphasized early integration and system-level testing, as our team had
previously focused on task-level testing (such as, the &ldquo;Torpedoes&rdquo; task
or an object sorting task), leading to undiscovered
failure modes when the vehicle executed sequences of RoboSub mission
challenges. (One such failure mode, paired with an unduly strong
assuption about course setup, directly lead to a sub-par performance
in the RoboSub 2016 Finals and our placing third rather than first.)</p>

<p>Leading the software team was one the most challenging, if not the most
challenging, experience I have had thus far.</p>

<p>I viewed our secondary vehicle as crucial to our success. By splitting tasks
between the subs and testing in paralell, this second &ldquo;minisub&rdquo;
would enable us to effectively double our testing time. During the
fall, I spent time
researching how to build a visual odometry algorithm in
order to enable position estimation on our small vehicle, which lacked
the sonar sensor traditionally required for underwater navigation. An
initial implementation worked well on indoor test data, but struggled
underwater, where patterns of dancing light from surface waves can cause false
motion.</p>

<p>During the spring, I shelved my visual odometry development in order to
focus on bringing the new vehicles into a state where the core vehicle
sensing and control was reliable and task-specific development could be reasonably
be carried out by our
software team members who would be staying over
the summer. We converged on a strategy in which our minisub would carry out
tasks which did not require position estimation, with our larger sub carring out
those that did. In particular, I focused on writing software to compensate
for noise in our acoustic sensors needed for pinger localization. At the same
time, I coordinated and worked on cross-subteam fixes to deal with
minisub control instability eaused by (1) our magentometer detecting
EM from upgraded thrusters and
(2) forward thrusters which exterted too much torque about the vehicle
center of mass. With the work the team did over
the summer, we managed to place first in RoboSub 2017. We achieved a
semi-finals score which was higher than the next best team by a factor
of ten, which was truly incredible. I was priveleged to have such a great team. Seeing both vehicles working
flawlessly in paralell was a moment I will never forget.</p>
